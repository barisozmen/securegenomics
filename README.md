# SecureGenomics™

**Compute on encrypted data. Zero trust. Full science**

SecureGenomics Engine is a platform for privacy-preserving genomic analysis using [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/07/20/homomorphic.html). It lets scientists run population-scale studies, GWAS, allele frequency analysis — all without ever decrypting sensitive data.

Built for:
- 🧪 Biobanks — monetize datasets without compromising privacy
- 🌍 GDPR/HIPAA-safe by design
- 🧠 Researchers — collaborate across silos, globally, securely
- 🔐 Privacy maximalists — zero-trust compute with cryptographic guarantees



> ⚠️ Alpha stage — active research tool. Contributions & collaborations welcome.

# How it works
### Bob (scientist) 👨
On his laptop 💻
```python
# Bob creates a new project
$ securegenomics project create
# ☝️ this command, asks Bob to choose an open-source, shareable experiment protocol from https://github.com/securegenomics/ . He chooses `protocol-alzheimers-sensitive-allele-frequency`. All protocols involve scripts for encoding, encryption, computation, decoding, and result interpretation

# Bob generates a public-private crypto context pair
$ securegenomics crypto_context generate <project-id> 
# ☝️ this command, under the hood, uploads public crypto context to the SecureGenomics server
```

### Alice (owns sensitive data) 👩
On her computer 🖥️
```bash
# 👨 – Hey Alice, can you contribute to my new experiment with your DNA?
# 👩 – Sure, I love science! But, but I also love my privacy :(
# 👨 – Don't worry, I know an awesome secure tool to do this! Use my <project-id>, encrypt your data and upload to the server!
# 👩 – Cool!

# Alice encodes her genomic data, using the project id
$ securegenomics data encode <project-id> data.vcf

# Alice encrypts her genomic data with Bob's public key
$ securegenomics data encrypt <project-id> data.vcf.encoded 
# ☝️ under the hood, it downloads public crypto context from SecureGenomics server

# Alice uploads encrypted data to the server
$ securegenomics data upload <project-id> data.vcf.encrypted

# ℹ️ All above commands use the online protocol code from shared experiment Github repository.
# 🔐 Protocol code scripts are hashed and signs all steps (knowing this isn't essential now, but helpful later)
```

### Others (own sensitive data too)
On their local computers 💻
```python
# Think what happened just above, and imagine a for loop with Dave, Frank, George, Carol, ...
```

### Same Bob again (the scientist) 👨
On his laptop 💻
```python
# Checks his project, and sees all his friends uploaded– 100s of encrypted genomes! 
$ securegenomics project view <project-id>

# Bob now runs the experiment
$ securegenomics project run <project-id>
# ☝️ FHE computation, as described in the protocol, is performed on the server.

# After, he downloads and decrypt experiment results with his private key
$ securegenomics project result <project-id>
```

What really happened?
- 🙋‍♂️ Bob is happy, because he did an analysis on lots of people's DNA
- 🙋‍♀️ Alice and other contributors are happy, because they kept their DNA private (cryptographically guaranteed)
- 🗄️🔐 Data was always in encrypted form on the server

## Experiment Protocols
Main Hub - [github.com/orgs/securegenomics/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/securegenomics/repositories)

Pick a research protocol above, or create your custom protocol and merge into this repo.

This is the truth base for all computations. You can verify and prove others which computation script was used in your experiment.

> Hyper-sharable, cryptographically verifiable science.

# What is cooking?

## 🔐 Hash-Based Provenance: Scientific Truth as a Chain of Commitments

Treat **every computation** as a cryptographically signed step:
- Every input dataset has a hash
- Every version of your code has a hash
- Each computation step generates a new hash by combining:
    - Data hash
    - Code hash
    - Config/parameter hash
    - Previous step hash (for lineage)

This results in a **chain of composable, tamper-proof proofs** that describe **exactly** how an output came to be — like Git commits, but across data + code + math.

📌 **Even if you don’t share your input data**, others can **verify** that your output hash is consistent with what it should be, given the hash of your data and your open-source computation protocol.
